/**
 * A KThread is a thread that can be used to execute Nachos kernel code. Nachos
 * allows multiple threads to run concurrently.
 *
 * To create a new thread of execution, first declare a class that implements
 * the <tt>Runnable</tt> interface. That class then implements the <tt>run</tt>
 * method. An instance of the class can then be allocated, passed as an
 * argument when creating <tt>KThread</tt>, and forked. For example, a thread
 * that computes pi could be written as follows:
 *
 * <p><blockquote><pre>
 * class PiRun implements Runnable {
 *     public void run() {
 *         // compute pi
 *         ...
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * <p>The following code would then create a thread and start it running:
 *
 * <p><blockquote><pre>
 * PiRun p = new PiRun();
 * new KThread(p).fork();
 * </pre></blockquote>
